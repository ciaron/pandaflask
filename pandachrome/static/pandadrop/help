NAMING GALLERIES
================

Galleries are named according to the name of the folder they're in. Spaces are
allowed, but some special characters may not be. This depends on what characters
you're allowed to use in filenames on your computer. 

NAMING IMAGES / IMAGE TITLES
============================

Image titles are determined by the structure of the filename:

  01_IMG_2914[The Title Of This Image].JPG

   ^    ^                ^              ^
   |    |                |              |
   |    |                |              |
   |    |                |              |___ file extension, mandatory
   |    |                |
   |    |                |__ title of image which appears on the site
   |    |                       (surrounded by square brackets, spaces allowed)
   |    |
   |    |___________________ file-specific text (optional, eg original filename)
   |________________________ image order prefix (optional)


In the absence of a leading prefix, images will be ordered alphanumerically by
the second part (e.g. the IMG_2914 part in the above example)


Some image management tools (like Adobe Lightroom) allow you to write certain
information to the filename when you export them. EXIF title, for example, can
automatically be made part of the filename.

ORDER OF GALLERIES
==================

Galleries will be displayed on your site in alphabetical order. 

For example, the folders:

animals/
beaches/
colour/

will show galleries displayed in that order, with those names.

But if you want a different order, you can do that with a prefix on the folder
name. The prefix can be numbers or letters, and should be separated from the
rest of the folder name with an underscore (_).

For example:

01_beaches
02_colour
03_animals

will show up on your site as the following galleries:

beaches
colour
animals

You could achieve the same ordering thus:

x_beaches
y_colour
z_animals

The underscore lets us separate the name of the gallery to use on the site.

(TODO: configurable separator character?)

You can mix numbers and letters too! The ordering is then based on the table
below. Notice that leading zeroes in numbers are significant, '02xxx' comes
before '1xxx'.

The following table show the order of characters as our system sees them:

  1    12 +  23 6  34 A  45 L  56 W  67 b  78 m  89 x
  2 !  13 ,  24 7  35 B  46 M  57 X  68 c  79 n  90 y
  3 "  14 -  25 8  36 C  47 N  58 Y  69 d  80 o  91 z
  4 #  15 .  26 9  37 D  48 O  59 Z  70 e  81 p  92 {
  5 $  16 /  27 :  38 E  49 P  60 [  71 f  82 q  93 |
  6 %  17 0  28 ;  39 F  50 Q  61 \  72 g  83 r  94 }
  7 &  18 1  29 <  40 G  51 R  62 ]  73 h  84 s  95 ~
  8 '  19 2  30 =  41 H  52 S  63 ^  74 i  85 t  96 
  9 (  20 3  31 >  42 I  53 T  64 _  75 j  86 u
 10 )  21 4  32 ?  43 J  54 U  65 `  76 k  87 v
 11 *  22 5  33 @  44 K  55 V  66 a  77 l  88 w

(Not all of these characters are valid in filenames, so watch out! I recommend
you stick to '0'-'9', 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '[', ']', '(' or ')'.

ORDERING OF IMAGES
==================

Images follow the same ordering scheme as galleries (see ORDER OF GALLERIES)
